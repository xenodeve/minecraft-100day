## T4 operating layer bootstrapped (2026-08-25, `/t4-project-bootstrap`, branch `main`)

**Goal:** turn a directory holding one design document into an agent-primary repo — one where a
fresh session recovers state from files rather than from the developer's memory, and where the
checkable rules are enforced by machines rather than by discipline.

**Shipped (Seed tier):**
- `.claude/hooks/` + `.claude/t4.json` + `.claude/settings.json` — session-start `using-t4`
  injection, per-turn rails reminder, `PreToolUse` gate (blocks `gh pr create` with no issue,
  blocks dangerous git, runs `verify` before `gh pr merge`).
- `.githooks/` — `pre-push` running `check-issue-ref`, `check-tree-budget`, `check-gate-ledger`.
  Agent-agnostic tier; binds any agent or human on this clone. **Opt-in: not yet enabled** —
  see the ledger.
- `.github/workflows/t4-verify.yml` — `lint` / `test` / `guards`. Scoped per ADR 0001.
- `scripts/validate/verify.mjs` — JSON + TOML + placeholder lint, `node --check` over KubeJS.
- `docs/agents/{workflow,domain}.md`, `docs/adr/README.md` + ADR 0001, `docs/OPEN-WORK-LEDGER.md`,
  `DONE.md`, `Obsidian-minecraft-100day/` vault, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`.

**Validation:** `node scripts/validate/verify.mjs` → passed. Verified *by observation*, not by
assumption, that the script actually fails: the first run exited 1 on two unfilled ORG and
DIST_DIR placeholders left in the upstream CI template, which is what prompted rewriting that
workflow for this repo. Stripped `using-t4.snapshot.md` measured at 8609 B against the 9000 B
injection budget.

(The token names above are written without their angle brackets on purpose — spelling them
literally would trip the placeholder check this very entry is describing.)

**Not done, deliberately:** `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.
`/setup-matt-pocock-skills` owns them and refuses model invocation
(`disable-model-invocation`), and its refusal text forbids reproducing its workflow by other
means. Left absent rather than written wrong. Tracked in the ledger, Track 0.

**Report:** `docs/adr/0001-ci-gate-scoped-to-modpack-reality.md`.

**Remote state:** `xenodeve/minecraft-100day` (public). 23 triage labels created, 2 already
existed (`wontfix`, and GitHub's default `bug`, renamed to `Bug`), 0 failed. Ruleset
`T4 main gate` active — PR-only, no force-push, no deletion, unresolved threads block merge.
Secret scanning and push protection enabled; Dependabot alerts and security PRs enabled.
`secret_scanning_validity_checks` and `secret_scanning_non_provider_patterns` were **not**
enabled — the API accepts the PATCH, returns 200, and leaves both `disabled`.

**Blocked:** GitHub Actions is billing-locked on the account, so `T4 verify` cannot run and the
three checks are not required by the ruleset. Filed as #1 with the reasoning for omitting them
rather than adding checks that would deadlock every PR.

**Next:** ledger Phase 0 — resolve #1, install packwiz + Java 17, enable `core.hooksPath`, run
`/setup-matt-pocock-skills` — and Phase 2 (resolve the Create major version), which is not
blocked by any of them.
